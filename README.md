# Dining-App

This app is an unfinished version of the Penn Dining section of Penn Mobile. 
It has a Table View in the DiningLocationViewController that displays the dining halls, although not the retail locations for the sake of saving time.
The Dining Location file defines the Dining Location class.
The MenuViewController file has the web view of the corresponding websites of each of the dining halls. The url of the one you click on is sent through the segue.
The DiningLocationViewController also fetches the data from the API and parses through the JSON, but this data isn't used due to lack of time.

I had a lot of work this weekend so I decided to stop working after five hours, and this is all I got done in that time.

Have a good day :)
